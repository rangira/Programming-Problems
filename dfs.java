Depth First Traversal for a Graph
Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. 
For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2. When we come to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it. 2 is also an adjacent vertex of 0. If we don’t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be processed again and it will become a non-terminating process. A Depth First Traversal of the following graph is 2, 0, 1, 3.



See this post for all applications of Depth First Traversal.
Following are implementations of simple Depth First Traversal. The C++ implementation uses adjacency list representation of graphs. STL‘s list container is used to store lists of adjacent nodes.

We strongly recommend that you click here and practice it, before moving on to the solution.

    void addEdge(int v, int w)

        // Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
        Iterator<Integer> i = adj[v].listIterator();
        while (i.hasNext())
        {
            int n = i.next();
            if (!visited[n])
                DFSUtil(n, visited);
        }
    }
 
    // The function to do DFS traversal. It uses recursive DFSUtil()
    void DFS(int v)
    {
        // Mark all the vertices as not visited(set as
        // false by default in java)
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
 
        // Call the recursive helper function to print DFS traversal
        DFSUtil(v, visited);
    }
 
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Graph g = new Graph(4);
 
        g.addEdge(0, 1);
        g.addEdge(0, 2);
        g.addEdge(1, 2);
        g.addEdge(2, 0);
        g.addEdge(2, 3);
        g.addEdge(3, 3);
 
        System.out.println("Following is Depth First Traversal "+
                           "(starting from vertex 2)");
