There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.

stairs

Consider the example shown in diagram. The value of n is 3. There are 3 ways to reach the top. The diagram is taken from Easier Fibonacci puzzles

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

More Examples:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
There is only one way to climb 1 stair

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
There are two ways: (1, 1) and (2)

Input: n = 4
Output: 5
(1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 2)
We can easily find recursive nature in above problem. The person can reach n’th stair from either (n-1)’th stair or from (n-2)’th stair. Let the total number of ways to reach n’t stair be ‘ways(n)’. The value of ‘ways(n)’ can be written as following.

    ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)
The above expression is actually the expression for Fibonacci numbers, but there is one thing to notice, the value of ways(n) is equal to fibonacci(n+1).

ways(1) = fib(2) = 1
ways(2) = fib(3) = 2
ways(3) = fib(4) = 3

So we can use function for fibonacci numbers to find the value of ways(n). Following is C++ implementation of the above idea.
CJava
class stairs
{
    // A simple recursive program to find n'th fibonacci number
    static int fib(int n)
    {
       if (n <= 1)
          return n;
       return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    }
     
    // Returns number of ways to reach s'th stair
    static int countWays(int s)
    {
        return fib(s + 1);
    }
 
 
    /* Driver program to test above function */
    public static void main (String args[])
    {
          int s = 4;
          System.out.println("Number of ways = "+ countWays(s));
    }
}
